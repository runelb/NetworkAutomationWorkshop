Ansible playbook for installing three NginX backend servers, running a PHP application, load balanced by a HAProxy frontend server


Includes:
site.yaml       - main Ansible file
nginx.conf      - default nginx server configuration (not to be confused with configurations for nginx itself)
index.php       - PHP file
haproxy.cfg     - configuration file for HAProxy


Works on a network like so:
(Internet)--->HAproxy
             (internal network using private address range)
              +--->A
              +--->B
              +--->C
(Internet)--->Bastion
